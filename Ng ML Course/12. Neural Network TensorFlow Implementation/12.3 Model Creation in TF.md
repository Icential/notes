There's a better way to initialize the model in [[12.1 Inference in TF]] through just using a new object from TensorFlow

1. Import libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
```

2. Create model
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
			tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 3, activation = "sigmoid"),
			tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")
])
```

3. Input vectors $\vec{x}$ for training and target labels $y$. This is in multiple arrays to represent the many cases per element
```python
x = np.array([[200, 17], [120, 5], [425, 20], [212, 18]])
y = np.array([1, 0, 0, 1]) # notice that this only needs 1 array
```

4. Train model
```python
model.compile(...)
model.fit(x, y)
```

5. Inference the model (predict with new input that the model hasn't seen)
```python
model.predict(new_x) # like new_x = np.array([[350, 9]])
```
