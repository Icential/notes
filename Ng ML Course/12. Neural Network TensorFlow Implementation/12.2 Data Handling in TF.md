Notice that in  [[4.2-4 Vectorization]] that the numpy array only has one array as the parameter. However as seen in [[12.1 Inference in TF]], there is an array inside the array as the parameter.

This is because an array inside an array represents a 2D array or matrix or somewhat as a tensor (a general form of a matrix). 

For example with the following code 
```python
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```
represents the following matrix $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6\end{bmatrix}$$
this is a 2x3 matrix (rows x columns)

So with the input vector in the previous section, it represents this
```python
x = np.array([[350, 7]])
```
as $$\begin{bmatrix}350 & 7\end{bmatrix}$$
which is a 1x2 matrix (row vector). TensorFlow accepts this.

Conversely, this represents
```python
x = np.array([[350], [7]])
```
as $$\begin{bmatrix}350 \\ 7\end{bmatrix}$$
which is a 2x1 matrix (column vector)

Meanwhile, this array with only one array as the parameter
```python
x = np.array([350, 7])
```
is just a 1D vector. It doesn't have a defined dimension unlike a matrix.


TensorFlow also uses another structure called a `tf.Tensor` when inputting numpy arrays into it.
So to convert from a tensor object `a` to a numpy array, use the following function:
```python
a = a.numpy()
```
