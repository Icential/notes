An image is just a 2D matrix of numbers from 0-255 assuming its in grayscale. This then can be compressed into a single vector with the number of elements being the width times the height in pixels.

This input vector is then sent as input for the first hidden layer which recognizes lines and shades in the input image. Which then gets sent to the second layer

The second layer recognizes specific parts of the head such as ears, mouth, eyes, etc. Which then gets sent to the third layer

The third layer recognizes the shape of the head and face as a whole. Which then gets sent to the output layer.

This then outputs the probability of that face being from some specific person.

This shows that each layer gradually creates and learns very correlated and important features by itself like an automatic feature engineering.
