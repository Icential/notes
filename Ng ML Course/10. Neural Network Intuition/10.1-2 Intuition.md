Neural Networks are machine learning models inspired by how the brain works.

These can be downloaded from other pre-trained models with their parameters.
Using predictions with these models is called inferencing.

Neural networks are related to Deep Learning.
	It can do speech recognitions, computer vision (images), NLP (natural language processing; ChatGPT), product recommendations, etc.

Neural networks are inspired by neurons in the brain.
	A neuron receives input(s) from their dendrites and manipulates that information into its own output which then gets inputted into another neuron and so on.

Mathematically, the neural network accepts one or more input which is some number into a neuron which then outputs another number. That number is then an input to a second neuron.
	Typically the models have more neurons than two; usually formed into a layer.

Neural networks only appear now because more and more data today are being digitalized and can be simulated with neural networks which are digital. Bigger neural networks with more data will perform better than smaller models such as linear regression or logistic regression.
