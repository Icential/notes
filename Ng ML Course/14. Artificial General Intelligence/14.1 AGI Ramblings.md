Even with the extremely rapid advancement of AI, it is going to take a long time for it to match the intelligence of the human brain.

AI can be split into two things: ANI (artificial narrow intelligence) and AGI (artificial general intelligence)
- ANI examples are smart speaker, self-driving car, computer vision
- AGI is anything a human can do.

Despite that there is a lot of AI, this means that there is a lot of progress in ANI not AGI. AGI has barely been developed but there is a very very slow rise to it.

Perhaps if we can simulate a lot of neurons like the amount the human brain can do. ANI will become AGI!
However that is not true because the mathematical models that represent neurons are way too simple on what actually goes on in the human brain neuron. We have no idea what goes on there.

However there is possibility in AGI. Think about the "one learning algorithm" hypothesis
	Simply, with any input and there is a sudden change to that input, the brain can adapt to the change in that input
	e.g. rewire feeling sensor in the brain to just sight input, that sensor will adapt to know how to feel with just sight.

Therefore this implies that there needs to be an algorithm that can take absolutely any input and output the same y and flexibly adapt to change in the input.
