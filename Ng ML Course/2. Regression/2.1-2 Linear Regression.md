Linear regression is a supervised model. 

It is a type of regression model. Regression is where you predict numbers.

Given data points x and y, draw a linear function that fits the data points

1. First train model in training set with x (feature) and y (target label) denoted as (x, y)
2. Model predicts a linear function $f(x)=wx+b$ from a feature x to predicted estimated label $\hat{y}$
3. Use linear function on a test set
4. Evaluate how well the model did by its error.
