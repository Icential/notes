The neural network from Chapter 12 can be implemented with only using numpy with a similar manner on how TensorFlow does it, without using it.

1. Import numpy
```python
import numpy as np
```

2. Create inputs, weights and biases for model (arbitrary)
```python
W = np.array([[1, -3, 5],
			 [2, 4, -6]])

b = np.array([-1, 1, 2])

a_in = np.array([3, 4])
```

3. Define activation function (sigmoid)
```python
def g(z):
	y = 1 / (1 + np.e ** -z)
	return y
```

4.  Create layers function
```python
def dense(a_in, W, b):
	units = W.shape[1] # how many neurons in layer
	a_out = np.zeros(units) # create activation vector of all zeros
	
	for j in range(units):
		w = W[:, j] # get j'th neuron's weights
		z = np.dot(w, a_in) + b[j]
		a_out[j] = g(z)

	return a_out
```

5. Create sequential for the overall model
```python
def sequential(x):
	a1 = dense(x, W1, b1)
	a2 = dense(a1, W2, b2)
	a3 = dense(a2, W3, b3)
	a4 = dense(a3, W4, b4)
	return a_4
```

It really is just a bunch of matrix multiplication
