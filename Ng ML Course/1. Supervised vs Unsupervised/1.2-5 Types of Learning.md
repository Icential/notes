Supervised learning formally are models that map from x (input) to y (output)

It learns by giving right answers, then predicting it. Evaluate by how close it is to the right answer.

Examples:
- Email spam
- Speech recognition
- Translation
- Visual inspection

### Supervised Learning

With x and y from some data, you can make a best fit for finding an unknown x to a corresponding y.

- Regression: For some given x, it tries to predict infinitely many possible y (continuous)

- Classification: For some given x, predict a boolean output or more categories (3, 4, ...) y (discrete)

For two or more inputs, the model can find a boundary

### Unsupervised Learning

Like supervised learning but y (labels) does not exist. Find some pattern, structure or phenomena that exists in the unlabeled data.

Data only has input x but no labels y. Model finds structure in data.

- Clustering: For multiple inputs, it can cluster groups to show that there is pattern in similar data (e.g. compile news by using similar words, grouping customers based on buying habits)

- Anomaly Detection: Find unusual points that are not in common clusters (e.g. fraud detection)

- Dimensionality Reduction: Compress big dataset into much smaller dataset without losing information.
